##Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project
##Introduction

This repo contains my course project for Getting And Cleaning Data.

The repo contains my script for the project which is run_analysis.R.  
The code already assumes that the UCI data zip file has been downloaded and that the working directory is set to the same directory that contains this data.
The code then does the follwing:

    Assigns the data to variables in R
    Subsets the data so that only the relevant variables remain
    Combines the data sets
    Creates the variables names from the various supplemental files that contain the information
    Finds the mean of the data for each permutation of the variables "subject", "actvity" and "feature"

The CodeBook.md explains the variable names.
